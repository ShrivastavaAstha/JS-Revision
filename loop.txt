There are three conditions -:
1. Initial condition
   -->it gives the first condition of the loop , from here the loop is started by checking the initial condition.
   e.g. let index = 0

2. Satisfactory condition
   -->it is the second condition after following the intial condition loop checks this condition , it can either be true or false .
   e.g. index < 10

3. Update in index -:
   -->after checking the initial condition and Satisfactory condition , if the satisfactory condition is true it updates the 
      condition after each loop.
    e.g. index = index + 1 or i++
